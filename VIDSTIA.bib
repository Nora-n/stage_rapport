	abstract = {We report measurements of the mass density, Omega\_M, and cosmological-constant energy density, Omega\_Lambda, of the universe based on the analysis of 42 Type Ia supernovae discovered by the Supernova Cosmology Project. The magnitude-redshift data for these SNe, at redshifts between 0.18 and 0.83, are fit jointly with a set of SNe from the Calan/Tololo Supernova Survey, at redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the cosmological parameters. All SN peak magnitudes are standardized using a SN Ia lightcurve width-luminosity relation. The measurement yields a joint probability distribution of the cosmological parameters that is approximated by the relation 0.8 Omega\_M - 0.6 Omega\_Lambda {\textasciitilde}= -0.2 +/- 0.1 in the region of interest (Omega\_M {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 1.5). For a flat (Omega\_M + Omega\_Lambda = 1) cosmology we find Omega\_M = 0.28\{+0.09,-0.08\} (1 sigma statistical) \{+0.05,-0.04\} (identified systematics). The data are strongly inconsistent with a Lambda = 0 flat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe model. An open, Lambda = 0 cosmology also does not fit the data well: the data indicate that the cosmological constant is non-zero and positive, with a confidence of P(Lambda {\textgreater} 0) = 99\%, including the identified systematic uncertainties. The best-fit age of the universe relative to the Hubble time is t\_0 = 14.9\{+1.4,-1.1\} (0.63/h) Gyr for a flat cosmology. The size of our sample allows us to perform a variety of statistical tests to check for possible systematic errors and biases. We find no significant differences in either the host reddening distribution or Malmquist bias between the low-redshift Calan/Tololo sample and our high-redshift sample. The conclusions are robust whether or not a width-luminosity relation is used to standardize the SN peak magnitudes.},

	abstract = {We present observations of 10 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) between 0.16 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.62. With previous data from our High-Z Supernova Search Team, this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the Hubble constant (H\_0), the mass density (Omega\_M), the cosmological constant (Omega\_Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q\_0), and the dynamical age of the Universe (t\_0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10\% to 15\% farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega\_M=0.2) Universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater} 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q\_0 {\textless} 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega\_M {\textgreater} 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are consistent with q\_0 {\textless}0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two fitting methods respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega\_M=0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega\_Lambda{\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level. For a flat-Universe prior (Omega\_M+Omega\_Lambda=1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater}0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma level for the two fitting methods. A Universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega\_M=1) is ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma level. We estimate the size of systematic errors, including evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local flows, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects reconciles the data with Omega\_Lambda=0 and q\_0 {\textgreater} 0.},

	abstract = {The High-Z Supernova Search is an international collaboration to discover and monitor Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) at z \&gt; 0.2 with the aim of measuring cosmic deceleration and global curvature. Our collaboration has pursued a basic understanding of supernovae in the nearby universe, discovering and observing a large sample of objects and developing methods to measure accurate distances with SNe Ia. This paper describes the extension of this program to z \&gt;= 0.2, outlining our search techniques and follow-up program. We have devised high-throughput filters that provide accurate two-color rest frame B and V light curves of SNe Ia, enabling us to produce precise, extinction-corrected luminosity distances in the range 0.25 \&lt; z \&lt; 0.55. Sources of systematic error from K-corrections, extinction, selection effects, and evolution are investigated, and their effects estimated. We present photometric and spectral observations of SN 1995K, our program's first supernova (SN), and use the data to obtain a precise measurement of the luminosity distance to the z = 0.479 host galaxy. This object, when combined with a nearby sample of SNe, yields an estimate for the matter density of the universe of Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}M{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=-0.2{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+1.0{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.8{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} if Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Λ{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0. For a spatially flat universe composed of normal matter and a cosmological constant, we find Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}M{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=0.4{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.5{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.4{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Λ{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=0.6{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.4{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.5{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. We demonstrate that with a sample of {\textasciitilde}30 objects, we should be able to determine relative luminosity distances over the range 0 \&lt; z \&lt; 0.5 with sufficient precision to measure Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}M{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} with an uncertainty of +/-0.2. This work is based in part on observations at the European Southern Observatory, La Silla, Chile.},

	abstract = {We present optical light curves, redshifts, and classifications for 365 spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered by the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) Medium Deep Survey. We detail improvements to the PS1 SN photometry, astrometry, and calibration that reduce the systematic uncertainties in the PS1 SN Ia distances. We combine the subset of 279 PS1 SNe Ia (0.03 \&lt; z \&lt; 0.68) with useful distance estimates of SNe Ia from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), SNLS, and various low-z and Hubble Space Telescope samples to form the largest combined sample of SNe Ia, consisting of a total of 1048 SNe Ia in the range of 0.01 \&lt; z \&lt; 2.3, which we call the “Pantheon Sample.” When combining Planck 2015 cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements with the Pantheon SN sample, we find \{\{\{Ω \}\}\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}m{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=0.307+/- 0.012 and w=-1.026+/- 0.041 for the wCDM model. When the SN and CMB constraints are combined with constraints from BAO and local H {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} measurements, the analysis yields the most precise measurement of dark energy to date: \{w\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=-1.007+/- 0.089 and \{w\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}a{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=-0.222+/- 0.407 for the \{w\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\{w\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}a{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}CDM model. Tension with a cosmological constant previously seen in an analysis of PS1 and low-z SNe has diminished after an increase of 2× in the statistics of the PS1 sample, improved calibration and photometry, and stricter light-curve quality cuts. We find that the systematic uncertainties in our measurements of dark energy are almost as large as the statistical uncertainties, primarily due to limitations of modeling the low-redshift sample. This must be addressed for future progress in using SNe Ia to measure dark energy.},
