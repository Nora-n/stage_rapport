	abstract = {We present observations of 10 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) between 0.16 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.62. With previous data from our High-Z Supernova Search Team, this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the Hubble constant (H\_0), the mass density (Omega\_M), the cosmological constant (Omega\_Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q\_0), and the dynamical age of the Universe (t\_0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10\% to 15\% farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega\_M=0.2) Universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater} 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q\_0 {\textless} 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega\_M {\textgreater} 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are consistent with q\_0 {\textless}0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two fitting methods respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega\_M=0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega\_Lambda{\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level. For a flat-Universe prior (Omega\_M+Omega\_Lambda=1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater}0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma level for the two fitting methods. A Universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega\_M=1) is ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma level. We estimate the size of systematic errors, including evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local flows, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects reconciles the data with Omega\_Lambda=0 and q\_0 {\textgreater} 0.},

	abstract = {The High-Z Supernova Search is an international collaboration to discover and monitor Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) at z \&gt; 0.2 with the aim of measuring cosmic deceleration and global curvature. Our collaboration has pursued a basic understanding of supernovae in the nearby universe, discovering and observing a large sample of objects and developing methods to measure accurate distances with SNe Ia. This paper describes the extension of this program to z \&gt;= 0.2, outlining our search techniques and follow-up program. We have devised high-throughput filters that provide accurate two-color rest frame B and V light curves of SNe Ia, enabling us to produce precise, extinction-corrected luminosity distances in the range 0.25 \&lt; z \&lt; 0.55. Sources of systematic error from K-corrections, extinction, selection effects, and evolution are investigated, and their effects estimated. We present photometric and spectral observations of SN 1995K, our program's first supernova (SN), and use the data to obtain a precise measurement of the luminosity distance to the z = 0.479 host galaxy. This object, when combined with a nearby sample of SNe, yields an estimate for the matter density of the universe of Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}M{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=-0.2{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+1.0{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.8{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} if Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Λ{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0. For a spatially flat universe composed of normal matter and a cosmological constant, we find Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}M{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=0.4{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.5{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.4{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Λ{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=0.6{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.4{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.5{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}.

	abstract = {{\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We present cosmological constraints from a joint analysis of type Ia supernova (SN Ia) observations obtained by the SDSS-II and SNLS collaborations. The dataset includes several low-redshift samples (z\&lt; 0.1), all three seasons from the SDSS-II (0.05 \&lt;z\&lt; 0.4), and three years from SNLS (0.2 \&lt;z\&lt; 1), and it totals 740 spectroscopically confirmed type Ia supernovae with high-quality light curves. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We followed the methods and assumptions of the SNLS three-year data analysis except for the following important improvements: 1) the addition of the full SDSS-II spectroscopically-confirmed SN Ia sample in both the training of the SALT2 light-curve model and in the Hubble diagram analysis (374 SNe); 2) intercalibration of the SNLS and SDSS surveys and reduced systematic uncertainties in the photometric calibration, performed blindly with respect to the cosmology analysis; and 3) a thorough investigation of systematic errors associated with the SALT2 modeling of SN Ia light curves. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We produce recalibrated SN Ia light curves and associated distances for the SDSS-II and SNLS samples. The large SDSS-II sample provides an effective, independent, low-z anchor for the Hubble diagram and reduces the systematic error from calibration systematics in the low-z SN sample. For a flat ΛCDM cosmology, we find Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}m{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} =0.295 ± 0.034 (stat+sys), a value consistent with the most recent cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurement from the Planck and WMAP experiments. Our result is 1.8σ (stat+sys) different than the previously published result of SNLS three-year data. The change is due primarily to improvements in the SNLS photometric calibration. When combined with CMB constraints, we measure a constant dark-energy equation of state parameter w =-1.018 ± 0.057 (stat+sys) for a flat universe. Adding baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements gives similar constraints: w =-1.027 ± 0.055. Our supernova measurements provide the most stringent constraints to date on the nature of dark energy.

	abstract = {Precision cosmology with Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) makes use of the fact that SN Ia luminosities depend on their light-curve shapes and colours. Using Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) and other data, we show that there is an additional dependence on the global characteristics of their host galaxies: events of the same light-curve shape and colour are, on average, 0.08mag ({\textasciitilde}=4.0σ) brighter in massive host galaxies (presumably metal-rich) and galaxies with low specific star formation rates (sSFR). These trends do not depend on any assumed cosmological model, and are independent of the SN light-curve width: both fast and slow-declining events show the same trends. SNe Ia in galaxies with a low sSFR also have a smaller slope (`β') between their luminosities and colours with {\textasciitilde}2.7σ significance, and a smaller scatter on SN Ia Hubble diagrams (at 95 per cent confidence), though the significance of these effects is dependent on the reddest SNe. SN Ia colours are similar between low-mass and high-mass hosts, leading us to interpret their luminosity differences as an intrinsic property of the SNe and not of some external factor such as dust. If the host stellar mass is interpreted as a metallicity indicator using galaxy mass-metallicity relations, the luminosity trends are in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions. We show that the average stellar mass, and therefore the average metallicity, of our SN Ia host galaxies decreases with redshift. The SN Ia luminosity differences consequently introduce a systematic error in cosmological analyses, comparable to the current statistical uncertainties on parameters such as w, the equation of state of dark energy. We show that the use of two SN Ia absolute magnitudes, one for events in high-mass (metal-rich) galaxies and the other for events in low-mass (metal-poor) galaxies, adequately corrects for the differences. Cosmological fits incorporating these terms give a significant reduction in χ{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} (3.8σ-4.5σ) linear corrections based on host parameters do not perform as well. We conclude that all future SN Ia cosmological analyses should use a correction of this (or similar) form to control demographic shifts in the underlying galaxy population.},

	abstract = {Timmes et al. found that metallicity variations could theoretically account for a 25\% variation in the mass of {\textless}SUP{\textgreater}56{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}Ni synthesized in Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), and thus account for a large fraction of the scatter in observed SN Ia luminosities. Higher-metallicity progenitors are more neutron rich, producing more stable burning products relative to radioactive {\textless}SUP{\textgreater}56{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}Ni. We develop a new method for estimating bolometric luminosity and {\textless}SUP{\textgreater}56{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}Ni yield in SNe Ia and use it to test the theory with data from the Supernova Legacy Survey. We find that the average {\textless}SUP{\textgreater}56{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}Ni yield does drop in SNe Ia from high-metallicity environments, but the theory can only account for 7\%-10\% of the dispersion in SN Ia {\textless}SUP{\textgreater}56{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}Ni mass, and thus luminosity. This is because the effect is dominant at metallicities significantly above solar, whereas we find that SN hosts have predominantly subsolar or only moderately above-solar metallicities. We also show that allowing for changes in O/Fe with the metallicity [Fe/H] does not have a major effect on the theoretical prediction of Timmes et al., so long as one is using the O/H as the independent variable. Age may have a greater effect than metallicity—we find that the luminosity-weighted age of the host galaxy is correlated with {\textless}SUP{\textgreater}56{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}Ni yield, and thus more massive progenitors give rise to more luminous explosions. This is hard to understand if most SNe Ia explode when the primaries reach the Chandrasekhar mass. Finally, we test the findings of Gallagher et al. that the residuals of SNe Ia from the Hubble diagram are correlated with host galaxy metallicity, and we find no such correlation.},

	abstract = {As part of an on-going effort to identify, understand and correct for astrophysics biases in the standardization of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) for cosmology, we have statistically classified a large sample of nearby SNeIa into those located in predominantly younger or older environments. This classification is based on the specific star formation rate measured within a projected distance of 1kpc from each SN location (LsSFR). This is an important refinement compared to using the local star formation rate directly as it provides a normalization for relative numbers of available SN progenitors and is more robust against extinction by dust. We find that the SNeIa in predominantly younger environments are DY=0.163{\textbackslash}pm0.029 mag (5.7 sigma) fainter than those in predominantly older environments after conventional light-curve standardization. This is the strongest standardized SN Ia brightness systematic connected to host-galaxy environment measured to date. The well-established step in standardized brightnesses between SNeIa in hosts with lower or higher total stellar masses is smaller at DM=0.119{\textbackslash}pm0.032 mag (4.5 sigma), for the same set of SNeIa. When fit simultaneously, the environment age offset remains very significant, with DY=0.129{\textbackslash}pm0.032 mag (4.0 sigma), while the global stellar mass step is reduced to DM=0.064{\textbackslash}pm0.029 mag (2.2 sigma). Thus, approximately 70\% of the variance from the stellar mass step is due to an underlying dependence on environment-based progenitor age. Standardization using only the SNeIa in younger environments reduces the total dispersion from 0.142{\textbackslash}pm0.008 mag to 0.120{\textbackslash}pm0.010 mag. We show that as environment ages evolve with redshift a strong bias on measurement of the dark energy equation of state parameters can develop. Fortunately, data to measure and correct for this effect is likely to be available for many next-generation experiments. [abstract shorten]},

	abstract = {We derive empirical models for galaxy mass assembly histories, and convolve these with theoretical delay time distribution (DTD) models for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to derive the distribution of progenitor ages for all SNe Ia occurring at a given epoch of cosmic time. In actively star-forming galaxies, the progression of the star formation rate is shallower than a t{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} SN Ia DTD, so mean SN Ia ages peak at the DTD peak in all star-forming galaxies at all epochs of cosmic history. In passive galaxies, which have ceased star formation through some quenching process, the SN Ia age distribution peaks at the quenching epoch, which in passive galaxies evolves in redshift to track the past epoch of major star formation. Our models reproduce the SN Ia rate evolution in redshift, the relationship between SN Ia stretch and host mass, and the distribution of SN Ia host masses in a manner qualitatively consistent with observations. Our model naturally predicts that low-mass galaxies tend to be actively star-forming while massive galaxies are generally passive, consistent with observations of galaxy `downsizing'. Consequently, the mean ages of SNe Ia undergo a sharp transition from young ages at low host mass to old ages at high host mass, qualitatively similar to the transition of mean SN Ia Hubble residuals with host mass. The age discrepancy evolves with redshift in a manner currently not accounted for in SN Ia cosmology analyses. We thus suggest that SNe Ia selected only from actively star-forming galaxies will yield the most cosmologically uniform sample, due to the homogeneity of young SN Ia progenitor ages at all cosmological epochs.},

	abstract = {Aims:We present an empirical model of type Ia supernovae spectro-photometric evolution with time. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Methods: The model is built using a large data set including light-curves and spectra of both nearby and distant supernovae, the latter being observed by the SNLS collaboration. We derive the average spectral sequence of type Ia supernovae and their main variability components including a color variation law. The model allows us to measure distance moduli in the spectral range 2500-8000 Å with calculable uncertainties, including those arising from variability of spectral features. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Results: Thanks to the use of high-redshift SNe to model the rest-frame UV spectral energy distribution, we are able to derive improved distance estimates for SNe Ia in the redshift range 0.8\&lt;z\&lt;1.1. The model can also be used to improve spectroscopic identification algorithms, and derive photometric redshifts of distant type Ia supernovae.

	abstract = {We present 32 epochs of optical (3300-9700 Å) spectrophotometric observations of the nearby quintessential "normal" type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2011fe in the galaxy M101, extending from -15 to +97 d with respect to B-band maximum, obtained by the Nearby Supernova Factory collaboration. SN 2011fe is the closest (μ = 29.04) and brightest (B{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}max{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 9.94 mag) SN Ia observed since the advent of modern large scale programs for the intensive periodic followup of supernovae. Both synthetic light curve measurements and spectral feature analysis attest to the normality of SN 2011fe. There is very little evidence for reddening in its host galaxy. The homogeneous calibration, intensive time sampling, and high signal-to-noise ratio of the data set make it unique. Thus it is ideal for studying the physics of SN Ia explosions in detail, and for furthering the use of SNe Ia as standardizable candles for cosmology. Several such applications are shown, from the creation of a bolometric light curve and measurement of the {\textless}SUP{\textgreater}56{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}Ni mass, to the simulation ofdetection thresholds for unburned carbon, direct comparisons with other SNe Ia, and existing spectral templates.
