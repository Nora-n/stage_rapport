	abstract = {We present observations of 10 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) between 0.16 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.62. With previous data from our High-Z Supernova Search Team, this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the Hubble constant (H\_0), the mass density (Omega\_M), the cosmological constant (Omega\_Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q\_0), and the dynamical age of the Universe (t\_0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10\% to 15\% farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega\_M=0.2) Universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater} 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q\_0 {\textless} 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega\_M {\textgreater} 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are consistent with q\_0 {\textless}0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two fitting methods respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega\_M=0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega\_Lambda{\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level. For a flat-Universe prior (Omega\_M+Omega\_Lambda=1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater}0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma level for the two fitting methods. A Universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega\_M=1) is ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma level. We estimate the size of systematic errors, including evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local flows, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects reconciles the data with Omega\_Lambda=0 and q\_0 {\textgreater} 0.},

	abstract = {The High-Z Supernova Search is an international collaboration to discover and monitor Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) at z \&gt; 0.2 with the aim of measuring cosmic deceleration and global curvature. Our collaboration has pursued a basic understanding of supernovae in the nearby universe, discovering and observing a large sample of objects and developing methods to measure accurate distances with SNe Ia. This paper describes the extension of this program to z \&gt;= 0.2, outlining our search techniques and follow-up program. We have devised high-throughput filters that provide accurate two-color rest frame B and V light curves of SNe Ia, enabling us to produce precise, extinction-corrected luminosity distances in the range 0.25 \&lt; z \&lt; 0.55. Sources of systematic error from K-corrections, extinction, selection effects, and evolution are investigated, and their effects estimated. We present photometric and spectral observations of SN 1995K, our program's first supernova (SN), and use the data to obtain a precise measurement of the luminosity distance to the z = 0.479 host galaxy. This object, when combined with a nearby sample of SNe, yields an estimate for the matter density of the universe of Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}M{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=-0.2{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+1.0{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.8{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} if Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Λ{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0. For a spatially flat universe composed of normal matter and a cosmological constant, we find Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}M{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=0.4{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.5{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.4{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Λ{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=0.6{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.4{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.5{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. We demonstrate that with a sample of {\textasciitilde}30 objects, we should be able to determine relative luminosity distances over the range 0 \&lt; z \&lt; 0.5 with sufficient precision to measure Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}M{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} with an uncertainty of +/-0.2. This work is based in part on observations at the European Southern Observatory, La Silla, Chile.},
